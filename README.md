This project dives deep into the world of Polymorphism and Inheritance. 
    
The task of this project is to create a common class, "Person", to have common attributes
such as name, ssn, phone number, etc. then pass them on to child classes. 

Using many fundamental concepts of polymorphism such as overriding and overloading, 
concepts of inheritance like extending a parent class, and basic OOP
characteristics all work together to complete the task.
